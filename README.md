# Job-Market-Analysis-Data-ML-Positions
This project focuses on analyzing the job market for data-related and machine learning positions in a selected region (e.g., India or the United States). The primary goal is to understand the demand for roles such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineer by collecting and examining job postings from Linkedin.

# Job Market Analysis: Data & Machine Learning Positions

## Project Overview
This project explores the job market for **data-related and machine learning positions** in a selected region (e.g., India or US). Using **web scraping techniques**, job postings were collected from platforms such as **Indeed, Glassdoor, Naukri, and Monster**. The analysis focuses on identifying open positions, required skills, job types, and locations.

The project also highlights one **aspirational job role** and the skills required to transition into that role.

## Objectives
- Collect job market data using web scraping with keywords such as:
  - *Data Scientist*
  - *Data Engineer*
  - *ML Engineer*
- Analyze and visualize:
  - Titles of positions available
  - Locations (including remote opportunities)
  - Types of positions (Full-time vs Part-time)
  - Key skills required
- Identify an **ideal job role** and its skill requirements.
